# ParkMate
ParkMate offers a digital platform (web-App) that connects drivers to nearby available parking spaces and allows space owners to rent out unused garages or spots. Users can search for nearby parking, book, and pay for parking on an hourly basis, while hosts can manage availability and earnings.
